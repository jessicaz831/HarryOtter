A weird battle game made by a team of three. (2019) IMAGES ARE NOT MINE, CREDIT TO OWNERS.

Apologies for the file names. This was a project from school and changing the file names may cause errors in the program.

There are many classes in this program. 
There are three sections to this game. The shop, the battle, and the spell making.
I was in charge of coding the battle. The classes I coded are listed below:
- Battle.cs

- BattlePlayer.cs
- Dehentor.cs
- Dolores.cs
- Haremione.cs
